# Retail Sales Project

## Business problem 
In this project I help Martha have a deeper understanding of her motored vehicle company sales.

Key questions driving the project were: 
- How do sales evolve over time?
- Which products and categories drive revenue?
- Who are the most valuable customers? 

 To do this, I loaded and transformed the data to Power BI, created KPI measures and a dashboard which displays: 
 - KPIs: Total sales, number of customers , average order value, total quantity of sold product
- total sales over years by sale size :  to see how the business is growing over time
- total sales by product type : which products are sold most? 
- total sales by salesperson : who sells most and deserves a raise, who is performing badly? 
- total sales by country: where do we sell most?
- total sales by customer and deal size : to have a better look at our best customers
- slicers for sale status. 

## About the dataset 
The sales data is simulation and taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data). License CC0: Public Domain. 

## Tools: 
Power BI and Excel

## Main insights of the dashboard: 
- Classic car sales are the best product generate 36% of total revenue
- 36% of sales are to USA
- Our best salesperson made one big sale to Spain. 
- The sales have fallen 1.5 Million Dollars between 2004 and 2005 : mainly due to less medium size and small size sales.
